1. `// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT`: This is a comment that specifies the software license for the code. Here, it's the MIT license, which is a permissive open-source license.
2. `pragma solidity ^0.8.9;`: This line specifies the version of the Solidity compiler that should be used. The `^` symbol means that the code is compatible with version 0.8.9 and any version above it, as long as it doesn't break compatibility (e.g., 0.9.0 or 1.0.0 would not be compatible).

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
```

3. `import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";`: This line imports the ERC20 implementation from the OpenZeppelin library. OpenZeppelin is a popular library that provides secure and tested implementations of Ethereum standards, including ERC20.

```solidity
contract SimpleToken is ERC20 {
    constructor() ERC20("Metacrafter", "MTAC") {
        _mint(msg.sender, 100 * 10 ** decimals());
    }
}
```

4. `contract SimpleToken is ERC20 {`: This line defines a new contract named `SimpleToken` that inherits from the `ERC20` contract provided by OpenZeppelin.
5. `constructor() ERC20("Metacrafter", "MTAC") {`: This is the constructor of the `SimpleToken` contract. The `ERC20("Metacrafter", "MTAC")` part calls the constructor of the `ERC20` contract with the name and symbol of the token. So, this token will be called "Metacrafter" with the symbol "MTAC".
6. `_mint(msg.sender, 100 * 10 ** decimals());`: This line mints (creates) 100 tokens and assigns them to the address that deploys the contract (`msg.sender`). The `decimals()` function from the `ERC20` contract returns the number of decimal places the token uses (typically 18 for most ERC20 tokens). Therefore, `100 * 10 ** decimals()` ensures that 100 tokens are minted in the smallest units (called "wei" for ERC20 tokens), equivalent to 100 full tokens.
